1) Create a function to get the factoral of a number.
  Input: factoral(5)
  Output: 120

2) Create a function to get the power of a number. Multiply the first input x(second input) number of times 
  Input: power(2, 5)
  Output: 32  
  reason: 2x2x2x2x2

3) Reverse a string
  Input: reverse("Recursion Sucks")
  Output: "skcuS noisruceR"


4) Given an array of numbers, find the max sum using elements that are not adjacent to the previously included element.
For example, if I decide to use the first element `1`, I cannot include the second element `2` as they  are adjacent.
  Input: maxSum([1,2,9,4,5,0,4,11,6])
  Output: 26
  Reason: Max sum formed by {1,9,5,11}
